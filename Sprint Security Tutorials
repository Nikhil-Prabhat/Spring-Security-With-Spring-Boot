We are trying to achieve application level security.

Spring Security is a framework which provides application level security.

1. Login and Logout Functionality
2. Allow/Block Access to URLs to logged in users
3. Allow/Block Access to URLS to logged in users and with certain roles.
4. It handles common vulnerabilities
	* Session Fixation
	* Clickjacking
	* Click Site Request Forgery
	
Spring Security can do :

1. Username and password authentication
2. Single Sign On / OKTA / LDAP
3. App Level Authorization
4. Intra App Authorization like OAuth
5. Microservice Security (JWT)
6. Method Level Security

Five Spring Security Concepts :

1. Authentication : Who Are You
	Multi Factor Authetication : Knowledge Based Authentication + Possession Based Authentication [ Credentials with device which real user is expected of like  otp or password]
	
2. Authorization : Can this user  do what they are trying to do

3. Principal: The currently logged in user will verify you on the basis of credentials. This is basically for authentication.

4. Granted Authority : Authorization basically happens on the basis of this. i.e granted authority, what user is allowed to do [Fine Grained Access]

** To make the things simple, roles are created which is nothing but a set of authorities provided to the user. Every time we don't need  to provide the authorities manually, we will create roles and sync all the authorities with it, and when a new person joins, we can directly assign the roles. [Coarse Grained Access]
For ex : role_manager, role_clerk


LDAP Security is basically used when there are less users , so we can create a ldap file and use it as storage for authentication.

OAuth is basically used for authorization, as authentication is already done. OAuth is used for authorization between services i.e when one service tries to access another service, but need details for authorization.

Some Terminologies for OAuth :

1. Resource - The protected resource which needs to be accessed.
2. Resource Owner - An entity capable of granting access to protected resource.
3. Resource Server - The server which is holding the resource.
4. Client - The thing which is trying to access the resource on behalf of the request owner and with its authorization.
6. Authorization Server - The server issuing access token to the clients.

Use Case :

Let there be a person who wants to print photo from his google drive. So , the person will request the print service to talk to google drive service to print the photo.

Flow :

1. The person requests to print the photo from google drive.
2. The print service will connect with authorization server to get the authorization token.
3. Authorization server will send the request to the actual user to verify, if verified successfully, it'll send the authtoken to print service
4. The print service will again interact with authorization server to get the access token.
5. With the access token, the print service will try to access the resource from resource holder.
6. The resource holder will share the resource on the basis of access token and as per it's authorization.

Stateless REST API : Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information necessary for the server to fulfill that request. The server doesn't rely on any previous requests or sessions to process the current request.

Spring Security Filters
Request -> SecurityContextPersistenceFilter
         -> CsrfFilter
         -> LogoutFilter
         -> UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter
         -> DefaultLoginPageGeneratingFilter
         -> BasicAuthenticationFilter
         -> BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter
         -> RequestCacheAwareFilter
         -> SecurityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter
         -> AnonymousAuthenticationFilter
         -> SessionManagementFilter
         -> ExceptionTranslationFilter
         -> FilterSecurityInterceptor
         -> Application (Controller or Resource)

1. SecurityContextPersistenceFilter
	Purpose: Loads the SecurityContext (e.g., authentication details) for the current request.
	Example: Retrieves a user's authentication state from the session.
2. CsrfFilter
	Purpose: Protects against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by validating CSRF tokens.
	Example: Verifies that form submissions originate from the legitimate user.
3. LogoutFilter
	Purpose: Handles user logout by invalidating sessions, clearing cookies, and redirecting to a logout page.
	Example: Clears security details when a user logs out.
4. UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter
	Purpose: Processes user login requests by validating username and password.
	Example: Authenticates credentials sent in a login form.
5. DefaultLoginPageGeneratingFilter
	Purpose: Generates a default login page if no custom login page is configured.
	Example: Automatically provides a login form for the application.
6. BasicAuthenticationFilter
	Purpose: Processes HTTP Basic Authentication headers for API requests.
	Example: Validates the Authorization: Basic header sent by clients.
7. BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter
	Purpose: Processes Bearer tokens for API requests (used with OAuth2/JWT).
	Example: Validates a JWT token in the Authorization: Bearer header.
8. RequestCacheAwareFilter
	Purpose: Manages cached requests during redirects (e.g., after login).
	Example: Redirects the user back to their original request after successful login.
9. SecurityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter
	Purpose: Wraps the HttpServletRequest to provide security-specific methods.
	Example: Makes the current user's details accessible via HttpServletRequest.
10. AnonymousAuthenticationFilter
	Purpose: Assigns anonymous authentication to unauthenticated users.
	Example: Allows anonymous users to access publicly available endpoints.
11. SessionManagementFilter
	Purpose: Ensures proper session management (e.g., concurrency control, invalid sessions).
	Example: Prevents multiple concurrent logins for the same user.
12. ExceptionTranslationFilter
	Purpose: Handles exceptions thrown during security checks, such as authentication or access denial.
	Example: Redirects unauthenticated users to a login page or returns a 401 Unauthorized error.
13. FilterSecurityInterceptor
	Purpose: The last filter in the chain; performs access control checks based on the security configuration.
	Example: Checks if a user has the required role to access a specific URL.
